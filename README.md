## How it works

Every Sunday, folks arrive on 14th street to meditate, connect and learn. Our Sundays
have a few different flavours, including:

- **Teacher led sessions**: teachers will guide students in a ~30 minute meditation, provide some instruction,
  and then facilitate peer connection.
- **Peer led sessions**: more informal, but students from the community will lead the ~30 minute meditation,
  may or may not offer a subsequent teaching, and then will facilitate peer connection. If you would like to sign up
  to lead a peer sit, please submit [this google form](https://forms.gle/eajirLyH8zQc7neq5).
- **Special Events**: guest teachers bring unique experiences and perspectives to the community, check out the calendar to see upcoming speakers.

## Dana

All teachings are offered freely in this community; ou are not required to pay to participate. That said, your generosity (dana in the language of the Buddhist teachings) supports this sangha and its teachers and facilitators to help them continue their work. It is a beautiful way of expressing gratitude. Our sangha’s Venmo account can be accessed through the QR code below. If you would like to direct your donation to a specific teacher or facilitator, please make this note when donating.

If you’d prefer to donate by credit card, PayPal, Zelle, or a physical check, that works too; instructions are found on the [IMCW site](https://imcw.org/giving/).
