# Downtown Dharma DC

Website for Downtown Dharma, a weekly local sangha in Washington D.C.

## About

Downtown Dharma meets every Sunday at 7pm EST at [Yoga District on 14th](https://goo.gl/maps/mnCS12etGDEZ4PhR9). You can also join us online on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/466237117?pwd=cGxHaTJlTVhBdldVSk8weDZuSW5udz09).

## How it works

Every Sunday, folks arrive on 14th street to meditate, connect and learn. Our Sundays
have a few different flavours, including:

- **Teacher led sessions**: teachers will guide students in a ~30 minute meditation, provide some instruction,
  and then facilitate peer connection.
- **Peer led sessions**: more informal, but students from the community will lead the ~30 minute meditation,
  may or may not offer a subsequent teaching, and then will facilitate peer connection. If you would like to sign up
  to lead a peer sit, please submit [this google form](https://forms.gle/eajirLyH8zQc7neq5).
- **Sit & Dine**: the least formal of all three -- someone gently guides a ~30 minute sit, and then we go 
get dinner
