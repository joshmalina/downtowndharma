# What is Downtown Dharma?

Rooted in the teachings of the Buddha, this welcoming community supports meditation practitioners in developing a steady, peaceful and open heart. Together, we seek to cultivate profound freedom—a freedom that equips each of us to meet the world’s pains with wisdom and compassion.

We meet in person and on Zoom every Sunday evening. Our gatherings typically include a 30-minute guided meditation, a short dharma (teaching) talk, and lots of time for sharing and community building. In addition, we organize monthly dinners, gather regularly to discuss books on mindfulness and Buddhism, and hold retreats and other events. 

All offerings are featured on our sangha (meditation community) [website](http://www.downtowndharmadc.org/), and are open to people of all identities, spiritual backgrounds, and levels of experience with meditation.

# What’s the history of this community?

In 2004, Downtown Dharma launched as a weekly mindfulness class on Sunday evenings at [All Souls Unitarian Church](https://all-souls.org/), in the DC neighborhood of Columbia Heights. It grew out of discussions between Peter Mosher, an All Souls member, and [Hugh Byrne](https://hugh-byrne.com/), a local meditation teacher. In the early years of the class, Hugh taught insight meditation while Peter (since deceased) led a Qigong practice. Over time additional teachers with the [Insight Meditation Community of Washington](https://imcw.org/) (IMCW) were added to the schedule to support the Sunday offering.

In the 2010s, Downtown Dharma’s weekly gatherings changed locations from All Souls to a series of other spots in NW DC—including the Church of the Savior, the Church of the Holy City, Potter’s House, Flow Yoga Studio and finally Yoga District (14th St Studio).

After convening exclusively on Zoom for 18 months due to COVID, Downtown Dharma resumed in-person gatherings in September 2021. Community members now join both in-person at Yoga District and online each week.

# Who are the lead teachers?

[Kristin Barker](https://imcw.org/teacher/?speakerId=140) is the sangha’s lead teacher and an affiliate teacher with IMCW supported by dana (generosity) from community members.

Guest facilitators step in frequently to guide on Sunday evenings, including Shawn Shafner, Mark Stone and others.

# What’s the relationship between Downtown Dharma, IMCW, and Yoga District?

Downtown Dharma is affiliated with IMCW (the Insight Meditation Community of Washington). Founded by Tara Brach, IMCW is a local nonprofit that harnesses Buddhist insight (vipassana) teachings to support individual and collective awakening from suffering, through the cultivation of a wise mind and loving heart.

IMCW is a network of weekly drop-in [meditation classes](https://imcw.org/communities/drop-in-classes/) across various locations in DC, MD, VA, and online. IMCW also hosts residential and daylong [retreats](https://imcw.org/events/?categoryId=101) throughout the year, as well as an array of [shared experience sanghas](https://imcw.org/communities/shared-experience-sanghas/) (e.g. for BIPOC individuals, LGBTQIA+ folks, Teens, Vegans, etc.). 

Since 2021, Downtown Dharma’s gatherings on Sunday evenings have been generously hosted by Yoga District at its 14th St studio. 

Together, our communities are committed to making meditation practice, wisdom teachings, and spiritual community widely accessible in the heart of DC.

# I’ve never attended before on Sunday. What should I expect?

Newcomers are always welcome. Please sign up in advance via the Yoga District [website](https://www.yogadistrict.com/schedule/). Also, plan to arrive 10 minutes before class so that a volunteer can greet you, orient you to the studio space, and answer any questions you might have. 

Most participants sit on the floor, making themselves comfortable for seated meditation with a combination of yoga blankets and bolsters. For those who prefer, folding chairs are available. 

Our Sunday gatherings always include time for meditation and community building, yet they have a few different flavors. These include:

- **Teacher-led evenings**: teachers guide students in a ~25 minute meditation, share a brief talk on a topic related to mindfulness or Buddhism, and then facilitate peer connection and dialogue.
- **Peer-led evenings**: a volunteer from the community leads the seated meditation period, may or may not offer a subsequent teaching, and then facilitates peer connection. If you would like to sign up to lead a peer sit, please put your name down [here](https://forms.gle/eajirLyH8zQc7neq5).
- **Insight Dialogue evenings**: offered on the third Sunday of each month, these sessions begin with a brief guided meditation and teaching, followed by relational mindfulness practice in pairs or small groups. Insight Dialogue provides a gentle, structured way to bring mindfulness into conversation—helping us stay more present, open, and connected with others.

Please look at the [calendar](http://www.downtowndharmadc.org/) to see what you can expect any given Sunday.

If you’re not able to join in person, you’re welcome to connect by Zoom using [this link](https://zoom.us/j/466237117?pwd=cGxHaTJlTVhBdldVSk8weDZuSW5udz09).

# Can you talk about parking and accessibility?

Yoga District’s [14th Street studio](https://www.yogadistrict.com/studios/14th-street/) is on the 3rd floor of a converted rowhouse, up two flights of stairs. The building does not have an elevator.

The studio is located two blocks from the U Street-Cardozo Metro station, and is well served by public transportation and bike infrastructure. There is no dedicated parking. If you are driving, please plan to arrive early to find street parking in the neighborhood.

Participants are asked to remove their shoes before entering the 3rd floor studio space. That said, if you need to keep your shoes on due to a physical issue, please let the studio volunteer know when checking in. 

Masks are currently optional for those joining in person. 

Most participants choose to sit on the floor, but folding chairs are available for those who prefer them. If you don’t see one upon entering, please let a volunteer know and they will grab one for you!

For anyone with a fragrance sensitivity, please feel free to [contact us](downtowndharma@googlegroups.com) beforehand or find the greeter volunteer when you arrive. We can help you find appropriate seating for proximate airflow. 

All Sunday night gatherings are accessible by Zoom; you can join using [this link](https://zoom.us/j/466237117?pwd=cGxHaTJlTVhBdldVSk8weDZuSW5udz09).

If you have any questions about accessibility, please contact [Travis Spencer](mailto:tspencer@iaam-dc.org).

# How do I offer dana (generosity)? 

All teachings are offered freely in this community - you are not required to pay to take part. That said, your generosity (*dana* in the language of the Buddhist teachings) supports this sangha and its teachers and facilitators to help them continue their work. It is a beautiful way of expressing gratitude. Our sangha’s Venmo account is [@DowntownDharma](https://account.venmo.com/u/downtowndharma). If you would like your donation to be directed to a specific teacher or facilitator, please make this note when donating.

If you’d prefer to donate by credit card, PayPal, Zelle, or a physical check, that works too; instructions are found on the [IMCW site](https://imcw.org/giving/).

# How can I volunteer? 

We eagerly welcome your generosity in the form of volunteering—it’s a great way to get to know your fellow community members. Each week, volunteers help to set up the Yoga District space, greet guests, and make sure that technology runs smoothly. If you’re interested in supporting our sangha in this way, please email [Kavya Sekar](mailto:kavsekar9@gmail.com). 

There are also frequent peer-led evenings, in which a volunteer facilitates meditation and community discussion. If you’d like to facilitate an upcoming Sunday, or want to propose or organize another activity related to meditation and mindfulness, please email [Jackie Powell](mailto:jackiesuepowell@gmail.com).

# How is dana (generosity) used to support this community?

Dana—generosity—has sustained Buddhist communities for over 2,500 years. Our sangha continues this tradition, relying on the goodwill of participants to support teachers, facilitators, and community needs.

All donations made to @DowntownDharma on Venmo go into a shared account stewarded by our volunteer board. Here’s how dana is currently used:
Donations allow us to offer a financial honorarium to each week’s facilitator, whether they’re a regular teacher or a guest. If the teacher is affiliated with IMCW, an additional 10% is forwarded to IMCW to support their administrative work.
On peer-led evenings, or when facilitators decline compensation, dana stays in the sangha account and helps fund future honoraria for our  teachers, ensuring we can continue to be generous in supporting their livelihood.

When needed, funds are also used for tech upgrades that support a welcoming and accessible experience—for example, microphones that allow Zoom participants to clearly hear those in the studio. Occasionally, dana may also help cover costs for community offerings like peer-led retreats or special events.
Your generosity supports a spirit of care, connection, and shared responsibility that keeps Downtown Dharma thriving.


# What else does this community do together (beyond Sunday evenings)?

We have an informal reading group (or book club) that meets once a month in community members’ homes. We discuss books, articles, podcasts or movies that relate to Buddhism and mindfulness. Unlike a traditional book club, there is no set membership, nor a requirement to participate every month—folks can join when they like, and there is never an obligation to host (though folks are welcome to raise their hand and offer if they are willing). 

The date varies each month, but these potluck-style gatherings typically take place on Saturdays at 6pm. Please join our [email listserv](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfVw58eEpX6RLRgHcvT_3_msKZ3wFEvjRWl7VEJD2HDO0xaVw/viewform) and Whatsapp community to learn what we’ll be discussing next, and when and where we’ll meet.

In addition, community members occasionally self-organize retreat weekends, volunteer events, and other social gatherings. These peer-led events are communicated via the email listserv and on WhatsApp.

# How do I learn to meditate?

We are fortunate to live in an age with so many apps, books and resources to help people learn how to meditate. Still, there’s nothing like the energy and support of sitting with other community members to bolster an emerging meditation practice. Newcomers are always welcome on Sunday evenings.

Also, based on your own learning preferences, you may find some of these resources helpful:

- **Class series:** IMCW offers many intro class series throughout the year (mostly via Zoom); current offerings are [here](https://imcw.org/events/?categoryId=124).
- **Tara Brach offerings:** IMCW founder Tara Brach’s classic PDF guide for new meditators is still a handy resource, and can be found [here](https://www.tarabrach.com/howtomeditate/). You can also subscribe to her free digital program [Mindfulness Daily](https://courses.tarabrach.com/courses/mindfulness-daily) (with Jack Kornfield)—a 40-day program that includes a short daily talk and guided meditation to jumpstart your practice.
- **Books:** Books that are frequently recommended in the insight tradition include:
  - Real Happiness: The Power of Meditation by Sharon Salzberg
  - The Experience of Insight by Joseph Goldstein
  - A Path with Heart by Jack Kornfield
  - Mindfulness in Plain English by Bhante Gunaratana
  - Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach
- **Apps:** Well-known apps for beginners include Ten Percent Happier and Headspace (both require a paid subscription). Insight Timer is a free app with guided meditations, a very popular timer feature and more. Waking Up is by author and podcast host Sam Harris, and helpful for exploring the philosophy and science of meditation.

# How do I become a member of this community?

Unlike some other spiritual traditions (including other lineages of Buddhism), there is no formal ritual or process for becoming a member of our sangha. Nor is there a specific financial commitment you’re expected to make. You are invited to participate in our community at the level and frequency that speaks to you, based on your own inner wisdom.

In addition to attending regularly on Sunday nights, those who are excited to deepen their engagement with our community have many options. These include:

- Becoming a [volunteer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tG72Rs-0lQ_DgE2jae_jmkwbv29wJAkBPVxqzuyCJcA/edit#bookmark=id.bk2ro6rfout)
- Supporting our teaching team by contributing [dana/generosity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tG72Rs-0lQ_DgE2jae_jmkwbv29wJAkBPVxqzuyCJcA/edit#heading=h.t9d5qcdhdt41)
- Joining a [Spiritual Friends group](https://imcw.org/communities/spiritual-friends-km-groups/) (*Kalyana Mitta*) with IMCW
- Organizing and/or hosting events & programming for our community

# Why is it called Downtown Dharma?

The Sanskrit word dharma (*dhamma* in Pali) has various meanings. In Buddhism, it’s most often used as a synonym for the teachings of the Buddha. More generally, the term can mean “the truth” or “the way things are”. As a community, Downtown Dharma honors and promotes the liberatory teachings and practices offered by the Buddha, which point the way to greater ease, peace and freedom—even amidst the stresses of living and working in downtown DC.
